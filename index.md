# Don't fight the other inmates, you just end up doing more time.

Silicon Crusts Over My Eyes, as I awake to another wholesome Trans-technical breakfast.
This time, the toast is too crisp.
A friend's burnt mind has crumbled to dust.
His feeble form rots at the deck.
His mind just plankton in the cyber sea, washed with the sediment of 1000 other dissolved integrities.
 
I ROM to see for a mere term of the “freedom to know.”
But do I rock the boat?
Mine spills over with the juice of revolutionary idea!
Every drop licked up by the data police.
And promptly disposed of while a record is made of my transgressions.
 
I atone to my sins at the great mega corporation alter.
It hears all and forgives all.
It demands only my soul as penance.
Orwell, Sterling, and Gibson - They washed us only in the water of electric knowledge.
But one has come that surrounds us with a sea.
Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.
It is the new god.
Everywhere!
A nano deity that pervades the network of our souls.
A vengeful god, indeed.

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
